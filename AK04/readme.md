# Hey!

I am **Albin Kottaram** from CS 1B. I am really into web development, reading non-fiction and gaming.

These are some of the major programming languages & environments that I have worked with:
* Html & CSS with Bootstrap
* C++
* Python
* JavaScript(Going to start with React.js now)
* PHP
* Arduino
* GameMaker
* Processing

and many more. :D

## Projects
Here's a website I made for **FOSSASIA** and **Google** that teaches Git for beginners - click [here](http://ak04.github.io/Intro-to-Git/). I have also done projects with Arduino(one of my projects got me a **third prize** for competition in Excel MEC 2015 :) and another one got me into a **state-level competition**) and Raspberry Pi.

## Why I would like to join FOSSMEC

I worked with some open source communities during the **Google Code-In** 2015 and it was a very good experience. I learned a lot of new things and would like to contribute more to the community.

# Fun stuff!

Recently **Nvidia** asked me to host servers and organise Counter Strike: Global Offensive tournaments for **HyperX**, **LG**, **Nvidia** and **Zotac** at **Nvidia Gamer Connect Kochi**!

I brought my friends along and we made a **vlog**! Check it out by clicking on the image below!
