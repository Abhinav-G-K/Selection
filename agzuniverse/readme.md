# Hi!
I am **Aswin G**, a.k.a "**A G Z**" currently in CS1A. I enjoy programming very much, and want to turn my passion into my profession.

## Stuff I like to do
My favorite thing to do is front-end web development.
I've got a couple of apps on the Google Play Store- [The Random App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agzuniverse.xapp) is probably the only decent one (lol).
I also participated in Google Code-In 2016 (Got a T-shirt and a sticker, thanks Google!)
Other things include Python bots to moderate IRC chat channels and simple games in various languages.

I also like to play around with Photoshop, edit and create short videos, write stories and play strategy games.

Currently working on some things with ~~Angular~~ React and ReactNative.

## Stuff I want to do

Arduino and embedded systems programming, make something awesome for RoboWars, and find a bunch of like minded programmers (already done, I guess?)

## Why I would like to join FOSSMEC
~~For the money and the placemenets obviously~~ I want to expland my skills, learn new things and apply my knowledge to code awesome applications that becomes useful to others, while hopefully finding some amazing friends along the way.
